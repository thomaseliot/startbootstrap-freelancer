<p>Creating connections in Altia 11 is performed in a slightly different manner than in prior versions of Altia.</p>
<p>In prior versions of Altia Design, each object had its own Connection list window.  In this version of Altia, all selected objects are displayed in a single list within the Connections pane.  Connecting two objects together is the same as before.  Simply hilight an output (plug) and an input (socket) and click the Connect button.</p>
<p>If the objects you wish to connect together are not at the same focus level, you can pin an object in the Connections pane list.  Pinned objects will remain displayed at the top of the list.  To make a connection, simply pin the first object, then navigate within the Universe window to the second object and select it.  Now both objects will be visible in the Connections pane list and you can select the Connectors you wish to link to create a Connection.</p>
<p> You can view this help at any time by hovering your mouse over the tooltip help indicator icon at the top right of the Connections pane, as shown below:</p>

# info for "please pick a control code statement"
message 200 center
The Code Assist tool helps create Altia Control Code Statements.
#
message 201 center
Select a statement type from the drop down control.  Press ENTER to when finished to create the control code statement on the current line in the text editor.  Pressing ENTER will also insert and advance to a new blank line.
#
# info for "COMMENT"
message 202 center
<b>COMMENT:</b> statements can be placed anywhere in the control code.
#
message 203 center
They are used to insert helpful information and do not affect control execution. Comments generally document what is being done and why it was done the way it was.
#
# info for "WHEN"
message 204 center
<b>WHEN:</b> Once the WHEN is defined, Altia Design will watch for an event that satisfies this relationship. When the relationship is true, the statements under the WHEN will be executed.
#
message 205 center
At the top-most level, you can specify what conditions to look for with one or more WHEN statements. Each WHEN statement consists of an animation/stimulus name, a value, and a relationship between the two. The value in the second field may be numeric or another animation/stimulus name.
#
# info for "ROUTINE"
message 206 center
<b>ROUTINE:</b> statements are listed at the top level of control along with WHEN statements, but they only execute when explicitly invoked using a CALL statement.
#
message 207 center
To create a ROUTINE, you fill in the routine name and, optionally, any routine parameters and locals. Parameters are names or values that represent values given to the ROUTINE when it is called. Locals are names needed to hold temporary values inside the routine when it executes. All control statements necessary to accomplish the sub-task are then added underneath the ROUTINE statement.
#
# info for "GLOBALS"
message 208 center
<b>GLOBALS:</b> statements are placed at the top level of control code. It declares the listed names to be global in scope, meaning all control statements for all objects can access them.
#
message 209 center
Multiple names are declared in a single GLOBALS statement by separating the names with space characters. Globals are storage elements for holding arithmetic results or strings required by WHEN and/or ROUTINE blocks.
The names appearing in a GLOBALS statement are only recognized within control and are not visible outside of control (i.e., they are not visible for animation, stimulus definitions, or external client applications).
Control globals are not given a formal type when they are declared in a GLOBALS statement. Instead, a global dynamically takes on a type based on the type of the value assigned to it from a SET, MATH, CALL, or EXPR statement.
#
# info for "IF"
message 210 center
<b>IF:</b> statements allows you to test the value of an animation, stimulus, control, global, parameter, or local name and take action based on the outcome of the test.
#
message 211 center
The IF permits conditional execution of control based on whether the relationship between the name and the value is true. The IF statement appears indented below the WHEN statement because the IF statement is subject to the WHEN statement.
Fill in the animation/stimulus/control/global/parameter/local name and the value to test against.  If the name typed into the first field is new and, therefore, has no current value, its value will be 0 for the purposes of the IF statement execution.
#
# info for "ELSEIF"
message 212 center
<b>ELSEIF:</b> statement provides an easier way of specifying an ELSE followed by an IF.
#
message 213 center
If the preceding IF condition is false, the test of the ELSEIF condition will take place. If true, the control statements under the ELSEIF will be executed.
#
# info for "ELSE"
message 214 center
<b>ELSE:</b> statement handles the alternative case where the IF statement above it fails.
#
message 215 center
An ELSE sub-block gives your design the opportunity to execute a different sub-block should the IF condition not be met. Based on the test condition, either the control statements under the IF or those under the ELSE will be executed. The ELSE has no fields to populate since the matching IF defines the test.
#
# info for "AND"
message 216 center
<b>AND:</b> can be placed immediately after an IF/LOOP statment or more AND or OR statements.
#
message 217 center
The AND/OR statements are placed on the same line as the IF/LOOP statement. The AND/OR statements permit the creation of more complicated condition checks.
#
# info for "OR"
message 218 center
<b>OR:</b> can be placed immediately after an IF/LOOP statment or more AND or OR statements.
#
message 219 center
The AND/OR statements are placed on the same line as the IF/LOOP statement. The AND/OR statements permit the creation of more complicated condition checks.
#
# info for "EXPR"
message 220 center
<b>EXPR:</b> statement allows setting an animation, stimulus, global, routine local, or routine parameter name to the result of almost any mathematical or logical expression.
#
message 221 center
Legal operands in the expression field are:
<ul><li>an integer or floating point value</li>
<li>an animation/stimulus name (whose integer/floating point value will be used)</li>
<li>a global, routine local, or routine parameter name</li>
<li>a string enclosed in double-quotes (e.g., "Hello World") if a string is appropriate for the operation</li>
<li>a library function, specified by placing a $ in front of the name (e.g. $sin $floor $abs)</li>
<li>an interpreter command enclosed in brackets [] (e.g. $format and $scan)</li></ul>
#
# info for "MATH"
message 222 center
<b>MATH:</b> statement is used to set an animation, stimulus, control, global, parameter, or local name to a simple mathematical expression (usually involving another animation, stimulus, or control name).
#
message 223 center
Instead of setting a name’s value to a specific number, a MATH statement can change a name’s value by a particular formula (e.g., increasing the value by 1). As with the SET statement, execution of this statement generates an event for the name with a new value if the name is not a global nor routine local.
#
# info for "SET"
message 224 center
<b>SET:</b> statement lets you set the value for an animation, stimulus, control, global, parameter, or local name.
#
message 225 center
If the name is not a global and not a routine parameter nor local name, this can change the state of an animation and generate an event that can trigger the execution of other control blocks or start/stop timer stimulus.
#
# info for "LOOP"
message 226 center
<b>LOOP:</b> statements are used to repeat a section of control while a test condition is true.
#
message 227 center
A LOOP statement is used in conjunction with an END statement. The first time a running control block encounters a LOOP statement, it checks the WHILE condition to see if it is true. If so, Altia Design will execute each statement in the LOOP control block. When it reaches the end of the LOOP control block, Altia Design will check the WHILE condition to see if it is still true. If so, the whole LOOP control block will again be executed.
#
# info for "CALL"
message 228 center
<b>CALL:</b> statement transfers control to a ROUTINE that will execute prior to continuing with the next statement.
#
message 229 center
A CALL executes the named routine, giving it the values for the listed parameters. If filled in, the name in the RESULT field will be given the value returned by the routine.
#
# info for "RETURN"
message 230 center
<b>RETURN:</b> statement allows a ROUTINE block to return to its caller prior to the end of the routine and (optionally) return a value that will be assigned to the name in the matching CALL statement’s RESULT field.
#
message 231 center
The RETURN statement can appear anywhere within a ROUTINE block any number of times with different return values. The RETURN value can be a name (animation, stimulus, global, routine local or routine parameter) in which case the value associated with the name is the return value.
#
# info for "END"
message 232 center
<b>END:</b> statement is used to either finish a control block (WHEN or ROUTINE) or finish a control sub-block (IF, ELSE, ELSEIF, or LOOP).
#
message 233 center
For example, when you insert an IF statement, all statements entered after it will be indented underneath it and contingent upon it. When you insert an END statement to finish an IF subblock, the next statement entered will have the same left margin as the IF statement and will not be contingent upon it, unless it is an ELSE or ELSEIF statement.
#
# info for "OPEN"
message 234 center
<b>OPEN:</b> statement allows access a text file to read/write with the READ/WRITE statements.
#
message 235 center
The file name should be enclosed in double quotation marks.  Make sure to specify the correct file access of READ, WRITE, or APPEND.
#
# info for "WRITE"
message 236 center
<b>WRITE:</b> writes the given value to the given text file, appending the specified delimiter.
#
message 237 center
Use a WRITE statement to copy information received in, or generated by, your design to a text file.  In the "Write:" field enter either a name or a text string enclosed in double quotation marks (e.g., "Hello World"). If you insert a name, the value for the name at the time the WRITE statement is executed will be written to the indicated file in its textual form.
#
# info for "READ"
message 238 center
<b>READ:</b> reads a value from the given text file and sets the animation, stimulus, control, global, parameter, or local name to the value.
#
message 239 center
The text in the file should be numeric or a double-quoted string, delimited by the chosen delimiter. Like the SET and MATH statements, execution of this statement generates an event for the name with the new value if the name is not a global or routine local.
#
# info for "CLOSE"
message 240 center
<b>CLOSE:</b> statement is used to close a text file that you have accessed in a control block.
#
message 241 center
You may use an OPEN and one or more WRITE statements in a control block to access a file and write to it. However, if you want to READ that data from the file later in a control block, you must insert a CLOSE statement at some point before the first READ statement to ensure that the information at the beginning of the file will be available for reading.
#
# info for "OPEN_VIEW"
message 242 center
<b>OPEN_VIEW:</b> opens a new view into the current design. The new view is a completely separate window and usually displays a different portion of the design
#
message 243 center
A unique identification number (id) is assigned to the new view. If id is the number of an existing view, that view is updated according to the remaining values in the OPEN_VIEW statement. The ID cannot be 0 because this ID is reserved for the main view.
The area of the design that should appear in the view is specified with x and y, the design file coordinates that should appear at the lower left corner of the view. If unspecified, the defaults for the main view are used.
A new view is positioned relative to an existing reference window. The reference window can be the Root Window, which is the screen itself, the Main Window, which is the main Altia view, or another view window that has a specific ID number. Use the ref win menu to select the appropriate option. The relative position of the new view to the reference window's lower left corner is specified by setting ref x and ref y. If unspecified, the center of the reference window is chosen.
The new view's width and height are given in screen pixels. If left empty, the width and height of the main view are used.
The window style for a new view is specified by choosing Toplevel or Child from the style menu. A window with a Toplevel style is independent from its reference window. A Child style window will stay on top of its reference window and move when the reference window moves. Currently, only Toplevel is supported.
#
# info for "CLOSE_VIEW"
message 244 center
<b>CLOSE_VIEW:</b> closes a view previously opened with OPEN_VIEW.
#
message 245 center
The id field is the identification number of the view to close. It must be an ID number for a view previously opened with an OPEN_VIEW statement. An ID of 0 is ignored because it refers to the main view.
#
# info for "OPEN_DESIGN"
message 246 center
<b>OPEN_DESIGN:</b> opens a new design file in the current Altia session.
#
message 247 center
A unique identification number (id) is assigned to the new design. If id is the number of a design already open, that design is replaced by the new one and all its views are updated appropriately.
The FILE field may be a string between double quotes or any global/local name whose current value is a string. In addition, a text I/O object's text animation name can be used, as can @name, meaning use that name's value as the name whose value is to be substituted.
After a design is opened with OPEN_DESIGN, additional views into the new design can be opened using the OPEN_VIEW statement.
#
# info for "CLOSE_DESIGN"
message 248 center
<b>CLOSE_DESIGN:</b> closes a design previously opened with OPEN_DESIGN.
#
message 249 center
If one or more views are opened for the design with the identification number id, the views are closed automatically. An ID of 0 is ignored because it refers to the main view.
#
# info for "EXTERN"
message 250 center
<b>EXTERN:</b> statement is used to execute a routine residing in a shared library external to Altia Design.
#
message 251 center
The EXTERN statement executes the named routine from the named shared library.
One or more parameters may be passed to the routine by placing values or names in the Parameters field using spaces to separate the parameter items.
If filled in, the name in the RESULT field will be given the value returned by the external routine.
The type of the return value from the routine must be provided to ensure a correct conversion to an animation, stimulus, global, local, or parameter name type.  Possible types are String, Integer, or None. Change the return type by pressing on the current type label and selecting a new type from the resulting menu.

<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">Parameters are declared in the PARAMS field of the ROUTINE statement as one or more names or values separated by space characters. The number of items in the PARAMS line must match exactly with the number of PARAM items in each CALL statement that references the same ROUTINE name.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">Locals are declared in the LOCALS field of the ROUTINE statement as one or more names separated by space characters. As soon as a ROUTINE completes, the locals and their values are destroyed. </span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:12pt;"></p>

<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">The GLOBALS statement is placed at the top level of control code. It declares the listed names to be global in scope, meaning all control statements for all objects can access them. Multiple names are declared in a single GLOBALS statement by separating the names with space (" ") characters.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">A global is typically used to hold a temporary arithmetic result during a WHEN block execution and/or between WHEN and ROUTINE block executions until it is appropriate to assign the result to an animation name. This is in contrast to a local which is similar in capability and usage to a global but only persists during execution of the ROUTINE block in which the local is declared.</span></p>

<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">The END statement is used to either finish a control block (WHEN or ROUTINE) or finish a control sub-block (IF, ELSE, ELSEIF, or LOOP).</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">For example, when you insert an IF statement, all statements entered after it will be indented underneath it and contingent upon it. When you insert an END statement to finish an IF subblock, the next statement entered will have the same left margin as the IF statement and will not be contingent upon it, unless it is an ELSE or ELSEIF statement.</span></p>

<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">Use a WRITE statement to copy information received in, or generated by, your design to a text file.  For the "animation" parameter, enter either an animation name or a text string enclosed in double quotation marks. If you enter an animation name, the value for the name at the time the WRITE statement is executed will be written to the indicated file in its textual form.</span></p>

<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">The READ statement reads a value from the given text file and sets the animation, stimulus, control, global, parameter, or local name to the value.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">The text in the file should be numeric or a double-quoted string, delimited by the chosen delimiter. Like the SET and MATH statements, execution of this statement generates an event for the read animation name with the new value if the animation name is not a global or routine local.</span></p>

<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">The CLOSE statement is used to close a text file that you have previously opened with an OPEN command.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">You may use an OPEN and one or more WRITE statements in a control block to access a file and write to it. However, if you want to READ that data from the file later in a control block, you must insert a CLOSE statement at some point before the first READ statement to ensure that the information at the beginning of the file will be available for reading.</span></p>

<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">OPEN_VIEW opens a new view into the current design. The new view is a completely separate window and usually displays a different portion of the design.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">A unique identification number (id) is assigned to the new view. If id is the number of an existing view, that view is updated according to the remaining values in the OPEN_VIEW statement. The ID cannot be 0 because this ID is reserved for the main view.  The area of the design that should appear in the view is specified with x and y, the design file coordinates that should appear at the lower left corner of the view. If unspecified, the defaults for the main view are used.  A new view is positioned relative to an existing reference window. The reference window can be the Root Window, which is the screen itself, the Main Window, which is the main Altia view, or another view window that has a specific ID number. Use the ref win menu to select the appropriate option. The relative position of the new view to the reference window's lower left corner is specified by setting ref x and ref y. If unspecified, the center of the reference window is chosen. The new view's width and height are given in screen pixels. If left empty, the width and height of the main view are used. The window style for a new view is specified by choosing Toplevel or Child from the style menu. A window with a Toplevel style is independent from its reference window. A Child style window will stay on top of its reference window and move when the reference window moves. Currently, only Toplevel is supported.</span></p>

<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">Check this option to remove rarely used advanced Text I/O features during DeepScreen code generation. This usually results in a significant memory savings. These advanced Text I/O animations are typically only used to create an interactive text entry field such as those found in the standard Inputs library of Altia Design.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">To exclude individual Text I/O's from this optimization, you may add a "DeepScreen Optimize" property to the desired object(s) in the Altia Design Properties pane. See the Standard Properties section of the Properties Editor chapter of the Altia Design User's Guide for details.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>

<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">Groups that are only organizational (i.e. do not effect child objects) are unnecessary and optimizing them out of the generated code can result in significant memory savings.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">When checked, this option will remove groups that do not affect their child object(s) (i.e. the group has no assigned color, font or opacity attributes, no transformations, and no defined Animation, Stimulus, Control Code or Connections).</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">To exclude individual groups from this optimization, you may add a "DeepScreen Optimize" property to the desired group(s) in the Altia Design Properties pane. See the Properties Editor chapter of the Altia Design User's Guide for details.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;font-size:8pt;"></p>
<p style=" margin-left:10px;"><span style=" font-size:8pt;">When the Dynamic Built-in Animations option is enabled, this option will be disabled. Superfluous groups cannot be removed because built-in functions in Control Logic or application code may dynamically reference a group's object ID.</span></p>
