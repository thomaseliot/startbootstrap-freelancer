*                     All ICU heap allocation, both for C and C++ new of ICU
*                     class types, comes through these functions.
*
*                     If you have a need to replace ICU allocation, this is the
*                     place to do it.

*                     Note that uprv_malloc(0) returns a non-NULL pointer, and
*                     that a subsequent free of that pointer value is a NOP.
