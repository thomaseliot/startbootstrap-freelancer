 *   UCommonData   An abstract interface for dealing with ICU Common Data Files.
 *                 ICU Common Data Files are a grouping of a number of individual
 *                 data items (resources, converters, tables, anything) into a
 *                 single file or dll.  The combined format includes a table of
 *                 contents for locating the individual items by name.
 *
 *                 Two formats for the table of contents are supported, which is
 *                 why there is an abstract inteface involved.
