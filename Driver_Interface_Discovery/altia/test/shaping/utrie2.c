*   This is a common implementation of a Unicode trie.
*   It is a kind of compressed, serializable table of 16- or 32-bit values associated with
*   Unicode code points (0..0x10ffff).
*   This is the second common version of a Unicode trie (hence the name UTrie2).
*   See utrie2.h for a comparison.
