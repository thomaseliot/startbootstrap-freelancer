<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">For each submission, you should
update this log with a list of ideas or suggestions you have for
improving the project.&nbsp; This could include identifying bugs in the
project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the project
that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new features for
the simulator.&nbsp; If you have no suggestions or issues for a
particular project, add an entry that says "no suggestions" or
something similar.<br>

Project 8<br>
<ul>
  <li>It is unclear how the tasks in this project need to be split up. It says: "Additionally, each team member must EITHER do a design activity (secnarios/sequence diagrams/requirements) OR a test activity. (It is OK for someone to do both.) Each team member must satisfy the minimum stated per-member requirements." The min_reqs spreadsheet has rows for design tasks, and in previous projects it was explicitly stated that a row didn't need an entry for every team member. We interpreted this as it being OK for a member to participate in only testing and not design tasks, but it is not 100% clear to us that this is the intention.</li>

Overall Project Comments<br>
<ul>
  <li>Assign the runtime requirements monitors to be due earlier. This could even be as early as the design phase, or as late as when the code for that controller is due. They were as helpful if not more helpful than the unit / integration tests at working out bugs early on in the controller design. We didn't take them as seriously as we should have early enough. </li>
